# Authentication

You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the Virus.exchange API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Basic authentication

With basic authentication, you use your username and password to authenticate your HTTP requests. Here's how to authenticate using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with basic auth' }}
curl https://virus.exchange/api/login \
  -u username:password
```

This returns an API token that should be used in all following requests

## Bearer token header

When establishing a connection, you will need your access token — you will find it in the [Virus.exchange dashboard](https://virus.exchange/login) under API settings. Here's how to add the token to the request header using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with bearer token' }}
curl https://virus.exchange/api/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

Always keep your token safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.
